The biggest challenge of this project was adjusting the page layout to accomodate both illustration and text- initially these aspects were on seperate pages. In order to overcome this issue, I created a bar which drops down after the animation is played, providing spotlight for both text and images. This menu moves back up when clicked to allow further exploration of the page."
